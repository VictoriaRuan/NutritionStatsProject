# Nutrition Knowledge Survey Proposal

## Authors:

Katherine Wang, Victoria Ruan, Jane Yang

## Objectives:

- The purpose of the nutrition knowledge survey is to examine students’ understanding of basic nutrition knowledge. The survey will provide information for the Maple Flavor WeChat app development project, which aims to facilitate communication between students and cafeteria and promote healthy diets in campus.

## Population:

- All high school girls in Dalian Maple Leaf International School Girls’ Campus

## Sample size:

- n > 40

- total 6 classes will take the survey

## Sampling Method:

We will use multistage sampling method. 

1. Use grades as strata.

2. Each class is a cluster.

3. Randomly choose 2 classes in each grade. 

4. 1. Label each class based on the number of classes in each strata.
   2. Use a random number generator to produce 2 random integers
   3. Choose the classes with corresponding numbers as cluster samples.

5. Contain all students in 2 classes in the sample for each grade



## Survey Media:

- digital survey created from online poll platform

### Sample Statistics:

1. Sample mean
2. Sample standard deviation

### Calculation:

1. Each multiple choice question in the survey worth one mark. Full mark is 10. 
2. We will calculate the mean of the survey for each grade.
3. Calculate the 95% confidence interval based on the formula of one sample t-interval for population mean.

### Advanced:

Ideally, we will do the survey again after the launch of Maple Flavor App to investigate if there will be increase in the nutrition knowledge understanding due to the healthy diets promotion on the app. We will conduct a two sample t test for the difference of means if we have adequate time before summer holiday.
